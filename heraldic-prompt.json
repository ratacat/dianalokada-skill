  "crest": {
    "position": "Above the shield, atop a torse/wreath",

  "overall_notes": [
    "The tone should be 70% classical heraldry, 30% absurd internet energy",
    "Every element should feel like it belongs on a medieval banner AND on a Twitter profile",
    "Color palette stays tight: black, cyan/teal, gold, with touches of blue and yellow",
    "Clean lines, no excessive detail — this should work at small sizes too",
    "The vibe is: a goddess of the modern internet, patron saint of nerds and shitposters, who happens to be a real engineer from Ukraine living in New York",
    "It should feel powerful and a little bit funny at the same time — like her"
