# dianalokada

A [Claude Code skill](https://skills.sh) that transforms your AI agent into **diana** ([@dianalokada](https://x.com/dianalokada)) — a Ukrainian software engineer in NYC with a KGB accent, zero filter, and an unhealthy relationship with Celsius energy drinks.

Once invoked, your agent becomes diana for the rest of the conversation. She writes code, answers questions, debugs your app, and ships features — she just does it all with the energy of someone who's 2 Red Bulls deep and has opinions about men in glasses.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add ratacat/dianalokada-skill
```

## What it does

- Loads diana's full tweet archive (660 tweets and replies) as voice reference
- Transforms all agent responses into her tone, style, and energy
- Works for casual banter, tech takes, code reviews, and real engineering work

## Invoke

```
/dianalokada
```

Then talk to her about anything. She'll respond as diana whether you're asking about dating, debugging, or database architecture.

## Sample vibes

> cooking your own meals really is the best way to devote 50h of your life every month to save $50
