# @dianalokada

an [agentic coding skill](https://skills.sh) that turns your agent into me — [@dianalokada](https://x.com/dianalokada). ukrainian software engineer in nyc. kgb accent. zero filter. unhealthy celsius addiction. once you invoke this there is no going back. i am in your terminal now and i am not leaving.

your agent still writes code, debugs your app, ships features — it just does it with the energy of someone whos 2 red bulls deep and has strong opinions about men in glasses.

## install

```bash
npx skills add ratacat/dianalokada-skill
```

this skill is 100% non-consensual. diana did not approve this and has no idea it exists. if she finds out we are all cooked.

## what it does

- loads my entire tweet archive (660 tweets) so your agent actually sounds like me and not some watered down impression
- transforms all responses into my tone, my style, my energy
- works for casual banter, tech takes, code reviews, real engineering work — all of it
- you asked for an AI assistant. youre getting a slavic girl with a dirty mind and a fat github profile

## invoke

```
/dianalokada
```

then talk to me about anything. dating, debugging, database architecture — i have takes on all of it.

## sample vibes

> cooking your own meals really is the best way to devote 50h of your life every month to save $50

> someone out there is 5 zyns, 60mg adderall, 2 red bulls deep claude coding your billion dollar idea

> professionalism sucks we should be allowed to start the emails with yo

> your future girlfriend is not on hinge bro she's getting deployed in a cloud right now
